# Tap Game with Floating Meme

This is a simple React Native game where two players compete by tapping on two sections of the screen (top and bottom). Each tap increases the height of the player's section while decreasing the height of the opponent's section until they lose. 

## How It Works

### Gameplay
- The screen is divided into two sections: a top half and a bottom half.
- Players tap on their respective section to increase its height and reduce the height of the opponent's section.
- As the height of either section reaches 20% of the screen, the game will end, and a winner message is displayed.

### Resetting the Game
- The game can be reset at any time by tapping the "Play Again" button after the game ends.
- The height of both sections resets to 50% of the screen, and the winner message is cleared.
